# R Code

## Requirements

[R](http://www.r-project.org) version 3.0 with the following
requirements:

- optparse v1.0.2
- phyloseq v1.6.1
- ggplot2 v0.9.3.1
- reshape2 v1.2.2
- plyr v1.8.1

## Instructions

- `make` - plot all the plots.
- `make -j 24` - quickly plot all the plots.

## Details

First run `bin/write-rdata` to load the OTU table, metadata, and
taxonomies into R and create a Phyloseq object and write this object to
`stdout`. The rest of the scripts take this object as input.  This way
you can be sure the number of samples is consistent between scripts. It
also has the added benefit of making things a lot faster.

### Example

```sh

bin/write-rdata \
  --otutable otus.csv \
  --metadata metadata.csv \
  --taxonomies taxonomies.csv \
  # rarefy to 10k reads per sample \
  # excludes samples with < 10k reads \
  --rarefy 10000 \
  --output experiment.RData

bin/sliding-window-smooth \
  --input experiment.Rdata \
  --rank Genus \
  --output sliding-window-Genus.pdf \
  # number of windows \
  --cuts 12 \
  # plot only top n Genera \
  --top 12
```
